# NoSQL-Social-API
Module 18 Challenge

## Description

This is an API that I've created using several technologies. I have mainly used JavaScript but I also used Mongoose to connect to the MongoDB database, Luxon to connect and format my date and time aspects of the app, Express to establish most of the server information, Insomnia to test our routes, and MongoDB Compass to test the database.

## Usage

This back-end application can be used to run social media platforms in a large capacity due to the use of NoSQL's Database. The end user can create a user profile, they can post thoughts that will be associated with their profile, they can add other users as friends and add reactions to their friend's posted thoughts. The user can also remove friends, thoughts and reactions. All of this can be customized to the liking of the end-user.

## Get Started

When you open your command cli and start up MongoDB by entering `mongod` into the terminal, and you start up the application through your Visual Studio Code terminal by entering ` node index ` you should be running a fully functioning easy to use Social Media API. You can see all of the functionality in the walkthrough video that has been linked for you at the bottom of this README.
